# The Pledge Community Agreement

Being part of the Pledge Community is a non-binding and voluntary agreement between the Venture Fund and Pledge Members. It is not linked to any potential grants given by the Venture Fund as part of its regular investment process.

## Background
Despite the strong alignment between founders and the Venture Fund, there is currently no established mechanism for continued collaboration after graduation from the mentorship program or for founders to contribute back to the fund - a missed opportunity on both sides.
Therefore, the Pledge Community is made up of a select group of the Fund’s alumni with the goal of bringing together a motivated and diverse circle of peers, willing to deploy resources and knowledge to help create a sustainable and re-generative Fund model that further catalyzes the impact of the Fund.

## Mission of the Pledge Community

### Pledge Member's Mission
The purpose is for Pledge Members to accelerate support for the Fund’s investments in just and open innovation for children and young people, leveraging their influence, skills and resources.
The intent is to give back the opportunity for current and future Venture Fund portfolio companies to benefit from the wealth of knowledge, experience, and capital among its diverse alumni network.
The Pledge Members aim to share a proportion of their financial success over time, with causes they are aligned with, in the form of voluntary donations to the Venture Fund.
Once a donation has been made, Pledge Members become a “Pledge Member and Donor”. If the ability to provide financial contributions is limited, in-kind contributions can also provide value in the meantime.  

**_Give back opportunities could include, but are not limited to:_**
* **_[Financial donations to the Venture Fund](https://form.jotform.com/243263991318058)_** (up to the total financial contribution received by the Venture Fund as part of their seed-stage and/or growth-stage funding program). Donations can be made at any time, or may be triggered by:
    * A liquidity event, such as a merger or acquisition where the Member team benefits from liquidity. It could also present an opportunity to advocate for a donation to the Venture Fund as part of the acquisition price or terms
    * Reaching a consistent and sustainable revenue stream, and a positive operating profit, for more than 2 years 
    * Capital raising activities (during or after), which is providing liquidity to the Member team (or via the external Investor
